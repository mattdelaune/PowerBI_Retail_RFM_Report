## Insights and Analysis

### Recency Insights
The majority of customers have made recent purchases, indicating high engagement.
A significant drop-off in customer count as recency values increase suggests a need for retention strategies.
### Frequency Insights
High-frequency customers are loyal and frequently return to make purchases.
Targeting low-frequency customers with marketing campaigns can increase their engagement.
### Monetary Insights
High-value segments like "Champions" and "Promising Customers" contribute significantly to revenue.
Segments at risk of churning need targeted campaigns to maintain their engagement.
### Future Work
Data Refresh: Implementing automatic data refresh to keep the dashboard updated.
Advanced Analytics: Adding predictive analytics to forecast customer behavior.
Publication: Exploring ways to publish the dashboard for broader access.
