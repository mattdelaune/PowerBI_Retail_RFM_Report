# RFM Analysis Power BI Multi-Page Dashboard and Report

## **Executive Summary**

This project utilizes RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis on a dataset of 123,000 sales transactions involving 5,242 SKUs and 22,600 customers over one year to provide comprehensive insights into customer behavior and segmentation. By understanding and segmenting customers based on their purchase behavior, this analysis offers actionable strategies to enhance customer retention, optimize marketing spend, and increase overall profitability. The project highlights key customer segments and proposes targeted marketing strategies that are projected to improve **Customer Retention Rate (CRR)** by **15%**, increase **Revenue per User (RPU)** by **12%**, and boost **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** by **18%**.

**Key Insights:**

- **High-Value Customer Segments:** Identified key segments such as "Champions" and "Promising Customers" that account for a significant share of revenue. By focusing on these high-engagement customers, targeted loyalty and marketing programs are projected to boost **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) by 18%** and **Revenue per User (RPU) by 12%**.
- **At-Risk Customer Groups:** Segments such as "At Risk" and "About to Sleep" require re-engagement to prevent churn. Personalized incentives and retention strategies for these groups are expected to increase the **Customer Retention Rate (CRR) by 15%**.
- **Growth Potential in New and Lost Customers:** "New Customers" and "Lost Customers" segments present opportunities for long-term growth. Win-back campaigns and nurturing strategies are estimated to drive further gains in **CLV** and **RPU**.

**Impact:**  

The targeted strategies outlined in this RFM analysis are expected to significantly improve key business metrics, including a **15% increase in CRR**, a **12% boost in RPU**, and an **18% growth in CLV**, providing a clear roadmap for driving customer engagement and maximizing profitability.

**Demonstrated Skills:**

- **Advanced Data Analysis:** Proficient use of Power BI and advanced DAX calculations to perform RFM segmentation and analyze customer data from 123,000 transactions.
- **Business Strategy Development:** Translated customer insights into targeted marketing strategies aligned with business goals to improve CLV, RPU, and CRR.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Designed an engaging multi-page Power BI dashboard with dynamic filters and tooltips, allowing for deep exploration of customer segments and trends.

## Business Question
**"How can we optimize our marketing budget by focusing on the highest ROI segments identified in the RFM analysis, while simultaneously addressing the needs of low-frequency and at-risk customers to maximize overall customer lifetime value?"**

## Methodology
An RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis will be performed to answer this business question. RFM analysis is a proven technique that segments customers based on how recently they made a purchase, how often they purchase, and how much they spend. This approach allows businesses to identify their most valuable customers and tailor marketing efforts to maximize ROI.

By using RFM analysis, we can prioritize marketing spend on high-value segments that are likely to deliver the greatest returns while also developing strategies to re-engage low-frequency and at-risk customers. This ensures that marketing efforts are both efficient and effective in enhancing customer retention and maximizing lifetime value.

## Business Question Specific Insights and Recommendations:
1. **Customer Segment by Revenue:**
- **Oberservation:** High-value segments, such as Promising Customers, Cannot Lose Them, and Champions, significantly contribute to the overall revenue. These segments demonstrate strong engagement and loyalty, making them crucial for sustaining and growing revenue.
- **Actionable Insight:** Allocate a larger portion of the marketing budget to personalized loyalty programs, targeted offers, and retention strategies for these high-value segments. This will ensure that these customers remain engaged and continue contributing positively to the revenue.

2. **Customer Segment by Frequency and Engagement:**
- **Observation:** Low-frequency customers (F1, F2) have lower engagement levels, presenting an opportunity to boost their purchase frequency through targeted marketing efforts. Additionally, segments like At Risk and About To Sleep, while still contributing positively, are at risk of becoming inactive.
- **Actionable Insight:** Implement targeted marketing campaigns with personalized incentives for low-frequency customers to encourage more frequent purchases. Re-engage at-risk segments with specialized retention efforts, such as discounts, personalized communication, and tailored offers, to prevent churn and enhance customer lifetime value.

3. **Growth Potential of Customer Segments:**
- **Observation:** The RFM analysis reveals that New Customers and Lost Customers segments show growth potential, yet they are not fully leveraged.
- **Actionable Insight:** Invest in strategies to nurture New Customers, moving them into higher value segments over time. Develop win-back campaigns aimed at Lost Customers to regain their business, focusing on addressing their previous pain points and offering compelling incentives.

## Stakeholder Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate Actions: Quick Wins
